# `operator-tooling`

This repository holds a set of commands to *ease* some OpenShift
Pipelines and Tektoncd operator automation.

It has been extracted from [`tektoncd/operator`] as it can be useful
to multiple operator. It will evolve over time to fullfill [`tektoncd/operator`] 
as well as possibily other operators.
